IH Image analysis


When images are originally pulled out they are very overexposed. They are at 100% brightness, the goal is to bring the majority of pixels
below 100% Bring down the intensity of the red and blue so the majority are less than 100%, THe blue doesnt mattera s much because we are only trying to look at where the blue overlaps with the red (colocalization). We are more wanting to look at the red instensity and quantity. 


Goal: Mask each color and analyze the red separetely before then looking at the colocalization with the blue. The green is the same as the red?. Capillaries that are running thourhg the slices should not be part of the analysis.
